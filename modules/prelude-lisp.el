(define-key read-expression-map (kbd "TAB") 'lisp-complete-symbol)

;; a great lisp coding hook
(defun prelude-lisp-coding-defaults ()
  (paredit-mode +1))

(setq prelude-lisp-coding-hook 'prelude-lisp-coding-defaults)

;; interactive modes don't need whitespace checks
(defun prelude-interactive-lisp-coding-defaults ()
  (paredit-mode +1)
  (prelude-turn-off-whitespace))

(setq prelude-interactive-lisp-coding-hook 'prelude-interactive-lisp-coding-defaults)
